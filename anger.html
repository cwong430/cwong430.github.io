<h1>What Peter Attia Taught Me about Anger Management</h1>
<p><p>

<b>Effects of Anger</b>
<p>
Anger doesn’t just cause shame in yourself, it affects your relationships.  People look at you differently.  They change the way they act around you, confide in you.

<span class="sidenote">“[Anger] totally contaminates the experience of people around me. So I have my wife and my daughters. And my anger for them is clearly toxic. And I have this commitment to letting go of it... if you can't be mindful, you actually have no choice. You know, you just, you will be angry, as long as you're angry. And the people around you who don't like it, just have to figure out somehow to put up with you.” The Drive, Ep 34</span>
<p>
Peter and Ryan Holiday, the author and Stoicism advocate, discuss how anger always results in negative consequences.  There’s always regret and shame afterwards.  The problem isn’t solved and then you have to deal with all the negative consequences.
